# What is this?
This is a feature-rich TypeScript server

# How do I run this?
Well, first you'll need to compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript.
- Run `npm i` to install all the dependencies
- Run `npx tsc` to compile the whole project or `npx tsc -w` to start the compiler in watch mode
- After that, just run the server normally via `node .` (or `node out/server.js`)
